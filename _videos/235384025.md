  The information age is transforming how we work, live and interact. We are all increasingly dependent on digital services to travel around, decide where to eat, learn, share info and maintain our public identity.
  
  And yet, digital services are increasingly provided by a diminishing group of super monopolies, whose real customers are advertisers. Or else, services spring up, only to disappear or change once acquired, our data lost.
  
  How do realise the vision for a resilient and open decentralised web? Can and should it be the default? Irina will talk about the motivations behind the redecentralise movement, some projects leading the charge and what challenges we could be tackling next.
