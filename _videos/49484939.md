  TITLE: User Stories and Acceptance Criteria for RESTful Services: RIP
  
  DESCRIPTION: In order to start the draft of a policy for RESTFul services, participants of this OGC Standards Working Group embarked on the development of RIP, a RESTful service acaluator that assesses and report on RESTful services against a continuously updated set of user stories and acceptance criteria. Many patterns are starting to emerge but there is more work to do especially in testing upcoming Hypermedia API's. RIP is certainly a great learning tool and provides a good insight in the evolution of RESTful services. It may be pointing to a set of best practices that could be used at the enterprise level.
