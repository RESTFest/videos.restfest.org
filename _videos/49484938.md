  TITLE: 7 Rs of Hypermedia
  
  DESCRIPTION: This workshop is an exercise in exploring the practical uses of hypermedia; a valuable reference resource for anyone who wants to see real world hypermedia usage. Through his work, Miller has identified seven different scenarios where hypermedia can be used within distributed applications: Relations, Resources, Reference Data, Restriction, Re-Distribution, Reduction, and Reactive.
