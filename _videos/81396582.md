  "REST is Just the Beginning" (Keynote)
  
  Deciding to build systems with REST isn't an endpoint. It isn't even really a goal. It is means to an end and a doorway to resource-oriented thinking. Hypermedia and Uniform Interfaces give us loosely-coupled and predictable systems but push the complexity of data integration to the client. The economic cost of integrating multiple sources remains high. Thin resource abstractions end at the HTTP boundary.
  
  What are some patterns that emerge from thinking in resources? How can we reduce the economic cost of integration? What would a resource-oriented computing environment look like? This talk will be a quick journey through some next level thinking about REST, the Semantic Web, Linked Data and a resource-oriented software platform.
