  TITLE: How To Follow Instructions
  
  DESCRIPTION: How do web service providers advertise their capabilities? By what alchemy do clients turn vague instructions from the server into specific HTTP requests? A talk about hypermedia and code on demand, as well as the not-so-great techniques web service designers (myself included) have been using instead of hypermedia and code on demand.
  
  PRESENTER: Leonard is the co-author of “RESTful Web Services” and the developer of Beautiful Soup. These days, he mostly writes science fiction.
