By what alchemy do clients turn vague instructions from the server into specific HTTP requests? A talk about hypermedia and code on demand, as well as the not-so-great techniques web service designers (myself included) have been using instead of hypermedia and code on demand.\n\nPRESENTER: Leonard is the co-author of “RESTful Web Services” and the developer of Beautiful Soup. These days, he mostly writes science fiction.",
