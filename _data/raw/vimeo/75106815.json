  "description": "This talk covers the Application-Level Profile Semantics or ALPS (2013) IDL format. \n\nALPS is designed to describe problem domains in ways that allow both client and server to \"understand\" and \"code-for\" all the possible transitions and data elements without having to constrain a server to a single workflow or implementation. ALPS is both protocol- and media type-agnostic; you can use the same IDL document to implement the solution using HTML for HTTP and Siren for WS. Servers are free to create their own solutions within the problem domain with a high degree of confidence and any client that also understands the same ALPS description will be able to successfully interact with that server - even if they have never \"met\" each other before.\n\nIs this possible? Does it solve a real problem? Let's find out!",
