  "description": "TITLE: RESTful API Design: How many versions?\n\nPRESENTER: Sam Ramji is a software strategist and open source pragmatist. He works at Apigee as the head of strategy, and volunteers at Outercurve Foundation (an open source foundation sponsored by Microsoft and AOL) and the Open Cloud Initiative. Sam grew up in Oakland, California and started programming at age 9 when the local public schools put in a set of Commodore Pet 16K computers. He stopped writing real code in 2000, but for some reason can't get away from software…and has been working in the industry since 1994. He’s a true, cognitive science geek.",
