  "description": "TITLE: HATEOAS Your Cake and Eat It Too: Turning Complex Business Processes into an Easy-To-Use API\n\nDESCRIPTION: We set out to build a HATEOAS server that had all the bells and whistles, only to find, well, not many pre-existing bells and whistles. By necessity we had to build our own HATEOAS server and figure out how to turn our complex e-commerce process into an API that required little training to succeed with. This talk will cover that journey and give some insight as to how to do it yourself.\n\nPRESENTER: Matt Bishop is the Senior Product Architect at Elastic Path (EP). He and the dev team at EP have been busy for the last 18 months building out a Level 3 REST (HATEOAS) API for their high-end ecommerce system. Before that Matt was an Innovation Architect at SAP researching REST, trying to find a way to move SAP from SOAP to REST (failed) he also researched Comet and mobile applications. Before that was a stint working on mobile apps in the technical service industry (lots of mud, dust and toxic waste). Before that Matt worked at BEA on Weblogic Workshop 7 and 8 (Eclipse sucked back then too). Before that he developed software to print magazines and newspapers which is way more interesting that it sounds. There's a few other before-thats, including Atari Computers (not the games). Matt has been building Internet apps (hello Server-Side Applets!) since when people thought AOL was the Internet and the cool kids had shotgunned dialup.",
