Doing anything creative takes commitment, focus, and often friendship.

Taking the first step is sometimes only that: one step. Taking the second,
the third, the fiftieth...those take kinship, help, support.

So. This month. Once you've picked your project, also pick a way to report
your progress--and get people to watch for it!

Here are some great options:
 - tweet (easy)
 - blog (bit harder)
 - a "calendar about nothing" (or [nothingcalendar.com](http://nothingcalendar.com))
   - a bit tricky to use, but click the dates to add red `X`'s on it...no more. no less.
 - use the [GitHub](http://github.com/) profile calendar page
 - use [Devpost](http://devpost.com/)
 - build something new!
   - it is Devcember after all

Whatever you pick, don't go it along. Tell the world. Tell your friends.
Tell your mirror. Just make sure you and your keyboard aren't facing the void alone.

It's only Devcember 2<sup>nd</sup>. Hang in there! :wink:
