title: Web Specification Spectacular!
---

It's Devcember again! This year, we're throwing a gaudy celebration of
Web specifications!

To join the celbration, simply do the following:
 - pick a spec, any spec (could even be yours!)
 - add your name, project, and spec links to the
 [celebrants.json file](https://github.com/Devcember/devcember.github.io/edit/master/_data/celebrants.json)
 - tweet us at [@devcember](https://twitter.com/devcember)

Interested in offering your awesomeness to others? Use our
[contact form](/contact)! We'd love free-month-long trials, books, and funding
support to help make this even more awesome for all!

Happy Devcember, everybody!
