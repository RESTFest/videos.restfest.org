title: Holiday Hackathon Time!
---

Devcember is that last month in the year where developers and dreamers can
knock out that last bit of code or write-up that idea that's been nagging them
for the past 11 months.

Devcember is an eggnog fueled, desert filled, world-wide code-a-thon about
giving the world a better Web.

In this single month, [Celebrants](/celebrants) (like you) give away code and
content that makes the Web better. You might implement a spec. You might write
your own quick spec. Or propose something on the
[W3C's Web Incubator](https://wicg.io/). The options are endless.

If you'd like to join in the fun, add your name to this year's list of
[Celebrants](/celebrants). Post your progress to the Web somewhere, and tell us
about it. We'll try and keep tabs on the amazingness as the month progresses.

Regardless, have a good time. Enjoy that eggnog, and be of good cheer!

Happy Holiday Hackathon-ing!
