title: Hacktivity Calendar Creation
---

To try and highlight some of the awesomeness happening this holiday season,
I've built a lightweight hacktivity calendar thing that uses
[Semantic-UI](http://semantic-ui.com/) cards and avatars to present who did
something on what day. The data is currently pulled from
[GitHub's search API](https://developer.github.com/v3/search/) and filtered
to just commits that have happened on or before <time>2017-12-01</time>.

There are other creative things happening other places, and I'd very much like
this to be more automated and less site specific. Hoping and having are two
different things, however, so feel free to pitch in if you're making something
somewhere else, but want credit on this Devcember's calendar.

Happy Hacking!
