title: Does your Project have the Monday's?
---

Has your side project or great idea had "the Monday's" like...all year?
Devcember is the month to fix that!

Commit to coding, creating, or curating this month and then give that work
long lasting value by sharing that work with the world.

We're working on a calendar to curate all the amazinginess being build this
month by you and other [Celebrants](/celebrants).

Happy Devcember!
