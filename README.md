# videos.restfest.org
Curation space for the REST Fest Videos Project content

## Currently

The `videos.restfest.org` sub-domain redirects to the [previous year's Vimeo channel](https://vimeo.com/channels/restfest2017). This is fine, but there's *so much more* we'd like to add, do, extend, etc.

## The Plan

We'd like this to be a GitHub Pages hosted static site with pages that "wrap" each video with additional content about the speaker, the content, topics, etc. We'd like it to be static, so it has the longest possible lifespan. However, that doesn't mean we can't use every availalbe REST API to generate/extract the content we need to build an amazing site. It also doesn't preclude any use of client-side REST API access for augmenting the static site when the page is loaded. Lot's of possibilites.
